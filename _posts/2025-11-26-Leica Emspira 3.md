# Leica Emspira 3

All information about the stereoscope can be found [Here](https://www.leica-microsystems.com/products/digital-microscopes/p/emspira-3/)

The microscope is a standalone instrument; all images are saved directly to a USB stick, so make sure you have one connected to the speed USB slot at the back of the microscope before you start working. 

The microscope software can be installed on any PC. You can download it from the MassLab drive  [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z7j4wysonebmClA7WCwn2JAU58sLmvsz/view?usp=sharing)

### Switch On

Wait for the LED to turn white (ready).

The live image appears on the monitor.

Turn on the light and if needed also the external lights.

### lenses
We have 1X and 0.3X lenses; only one can be installed at a time. The lenses are kept in a box in the cabinet above the microscope.

The 1X lens comes with an adaptor installed.

To replace a lens, first disconnect the light holder

Hold the lens from the bottom without touching the lens itself, then place it in the lens box (the X1 lens in a bag first). 

If the 1X lens is installed, disconnect the adaptor as well.

After replacing the lens, enter the settings and choose the correct lens. 

## Basic Operation

Click-stop: Push the slider toward the knob to enable fixed zoom steps (for measurements).

#### Illumination:
