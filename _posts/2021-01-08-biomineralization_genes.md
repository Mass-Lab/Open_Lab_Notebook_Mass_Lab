This [list](https://github.com/Mass-Lab/Open_Lab_Notebook_Mass_Lab/blob/master/Files/Biomineralization%20Toolkit_2.xlsx) comprehends all biomineralziation-related genes known from literature. The first reference is the one related to the accession number/gene ID, then we put all other references where that specific gene/protein was previously detected/immunolocalized (chronological order).
